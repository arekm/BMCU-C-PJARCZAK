Which firmware folder should I choose here?
Choose between: standard(A1) or high_force_load(P1S)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

standard(A1)
- Recommended for: Bambu Lab A1 (and most other setups) where filament does NOT require high pushing force to load.
- Choose this if: the PTFE tube between the BMCU and the printer is short and relatively straight (low friction).
- Goal: normal load force and standard pressure behavior.

high_force_load(P1S)
- Recommended for: Bambu Lab P1S (and similar printers/setups) where PTFE routing is long and has multiple bends.
- This mode uses: much stronger motor force during filament loading, and slightly higher pressure/holding behavior during printing to compensate for higher friction.
- Choose this if:
  - you have a P1S (typical long, curved PTFE path), or
  - your PTFE path is long/complex (many bends), even on A1, or
  - you experience loading problems such as rejected/failed load events (most commonly caused by too little pushing force during loading).

If you’re unsure:
- Start with standard(A1).
- If loading is inconsistent or gets rejected, switch to high_force_load(P1S).

[::] All modifications by Pawel Jarczak
[::] Also thanks to everyone on Reddit who tested this firmware on many different BMCU 370C builds.
[::] Special thanks to Remote-Trash4593 (Reddit) for the huge effort: extensive testing + detailed documentation.

[::] May compatibility with BambuLab last as long as possible.
[::] If they ever block this last lifeboat:
[::] - We should sell our printers and switch brands, defending our right to ownership and choice.
[::] - When many of us bought these printers, BMCU was supported without restrictions; limits appeared only after purchase.
[::] - BMCU was a key reason to buy; for many people AMS is too big, too expensive, and still has plenty of issues.
[::] - The market is full of amazing 3D printers that do not lock users out - and for many of us, a 3D printer is a critical work tool.
[::] - Open BMCU firmware gives us real freedom, and we should demand that freedom be respected.
