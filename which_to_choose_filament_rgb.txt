Which variant should I choose?
Choose between: FILAMENT_RGB_ON and FILAMENT_RGB_OFF.

FILAMENT_RGB_ON
- After a filament is loaded, the front LED (per channel) lights up in the selected filament color.
- The LED still reacts to buffer status (pressure) as usual.

FILAMENT_RGB_OFF
- Filament color display is disabled.
- The front LED only indicates buffer status:
  - centered/neutral position (when no filament is loaded),
  - buffer extremes (too much / too little pressure).


--------------------------------------------------------------------------


How FILAMENT_RGB_ON works

- When the firmware considers the filament "loaded" on a channel, the front LED for that channel is set
  to the filament color reported/stored for that slot.
- RGB LEDs can vary between modules: each LED may have different brightness balance for Red/Green/Blue,
  so the same filament color may look slightly different on different channels/modules.
- The colors can be quite bright, which may be distracting (especially at night in a room).
  If you want a calm/no-light setup, choose FILAMENT_RGB_OFF instead.

No other behavior changes - this option only affects the front LED.

[::] All modifications by Pawel Jarczak
[::] Also thanks to everyone on Reddit who tested this firmware on many different BMCU 370C builds.
[::] Special thanks to Remote-Trash4593 (Reddit) for the huge effort: extensive testing + detailed documentation.

[::] May compatibility with BambuLab last as long as possible.
[::] If they ever block this last lifeboat:
[::] - We should sell our printers and switch brands, defending our right to ownership and choice.
[::] - When many of us bought these printers, BMCU was supported without restrictions; limits appeared only after purchase.
[::] - BMCU was a key reason to buy; for many people AMS is too big, too expensive, and still has plenty of issues.
[::] - The market is full of amazing 3D printers that do not lock users out - and for many of us, a 3D printer is a critical work tool.
[::] - Open BMCU firmware gives us real freedom, and we should demand that freedom be respected.
