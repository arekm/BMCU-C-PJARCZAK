Which firmware folder should I choose here?
Choose between: SOLO, AMS_A, AMS_B, AMS_C, AMS_D.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------


SOLO firmware
Example file:
- solo_0.095f.bin

This firmware is intended for single-BMCU (SOLO) operation.
Recommended for single-BMCU setups.

Filament retraction length:
- 0.095 m = 9.5 cm


AMS_A / AMS_B / AMS_C / AMS_D firmware
These firmware versions are intended for:
- multi-BMCU setups and longer filament retraction distances.

If you have ONLY ONE BMCU but you need longer retraction than SOLO provides,
use AMS_A instead of SOLO.


Retraction length in filenames
Examples:
- ams_a_0.10f.bin  -> 0.10 m = 10 cm
- ams_a_0.50f.bin  -> 0.50 m = 50 cm
The number is the retraction length in meters.


Multi-BMCU setups (2-4 unit)
Each BMCU must have a different AMS slot firmware:
- 1st unit: AMS_A
- 2nd unit: AMS_B
- 3rd unit: AMS_C
- 4th unit: AMS_D


How to choose the correct retraction length (simple)
Retraction must be calculated from the end of the AMS splitter inside the printer
(the plastic AMS part where up to four PTFE tubes enter).

Example:
- Distance to the end of the AMS splitter: about 9.0 cm
- SOLO retracts about 9.5 cm, so it goes about 0.5 cm past the splitter

When calculating your own retraction length:
- Always measure from the end of the AMS splitter
- Add a small safety margin so the filament clears the splitter

Note for P1 printers:
- Many P1 setups use longer PTFE paths, so a longer retraction is often needed.
- Even with a single BMCU, AMS_A is often a better choice than SOLO (pick your needed length).

[::] All modifications by Pawel Jarczak
[::] Also thanks to everyone on Reddit who tested this firmware on many different BMCU 370C builds.
[::] Special thanks to Remote-Trash4593 (Reddit) for the huge effort: extensive testing + detailed documentation.

[::] May compatibility with BambuLab last as long as possible.
[::] If they ever block this last lifeboat:
[::] - We should sell our printers and switch brands, defending our right to ownership and choice.
[::] - When many of us bought these printers, BMCU was supported without restrictions; limits appeared only after purchase.
[::] - BMCU was a key reason to buy; for many people AMS is too big, too expensive, and still has plenty of issues.
[::] - The market is full of amazing 3D printers that do not lock users out - and for many of us, a 3D printer is a critical work tool.
[::] - Open BMCU firmware gives us real freedom, and we should demand that freedom be respected.
